# Machine Learning Pipeline

We look at the initial exploration when creating a machine learning pipeline by observing one of the most common applications -> The Boston Housing Prices dataset. The information presented here is a collection of work that I have studied in my University coursework, various books, MOOCs, websites and other educational sources.
